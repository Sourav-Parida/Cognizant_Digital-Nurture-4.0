1.	Understand Asymptotic Notation:
o	Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
o	Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.


Answer:- 
1. Understand Asymptotic Notation
a) Big O Notation and Its Importance
Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm’s running time or space requirement 
as a function of the input size n. It provides a high-level understanding of how an algorithm performs 
as the input grows larger and helps compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

It ignores constant factors and lower-order terms, focusing only on the
 dominant term that impacts scalability.
Helps developers choose the most efficient algorithm for large data sets.

Common Big O examples:
O(1): Constant time (e.g., accessing an array element)
O(log n): Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search)
O(n): Linear time (e.g., linear search)
O(n log n): Linearithmic (e.g., merge sort)
O(n²): Quadratic time (e.g., bubble sort)

b) Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations
In algorithm analysis, it's important to consider different input conditions:

Scenario  Explanation
Best Case:      The search finds the target in the first few comparisons.
Average Case:	The target is located somewhere in the middle, or equally likely anywhere.
Worst Case: 	The target is not found or found at the last comparison.

4.	Analysis:
o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
o	Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

Answer:- 
a) Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
Example: Linear Search on an array of n elements
Best case: O(1) → Target is at index 0.
Average case: O(n) → On average, checked n/2 elements.
Worst case: O(n) → Target is at the end or not present at all.

Example: Binary Search (on sorted array)
Best case: O(1) → Target is the middle element.
Average case: O(log n)
Worst case: O(log n) → Keep dividing search space until one element remains.



b) Suitable Algorithm for the Platform
Which algorithm is more suitable depends on the context:
If the data is unsorted and you're doing a single or few searches, Linear Search is 
suitable because it requires no preprocessing.

If the data is sorted or can be pre-sorted and you perform frequent searches, Binary Search 
is better due to its logarithmic time complexity.

For an e-commerce search platform, binary search (or even more advanced techniques like hash 
indexing or trie trees) would be more appropriate, provided the product listings are sorted or 
indexed, since performance and response time are critical.

Conclusion:
Binary Search is more efficient for sorted data, especially in systems where performance and
 scalability are essential.

Use Linear Search for small or unsorted datasets or where sorting is not feasible due to time 
or resource constraints.
